</ExpandableGroup>

## Automation with GitHub Actions

Automate your development workflow using GitHub Actions.

<CodeGroup tabs="CI,Deployment">
  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/ci.yml
  name: CI
  on: [push]
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Run tests
          run: npm test
  ```
  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/deploy.yml
  name: Deploy
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Deploy to production
          run: echo "Deploying..."
  ```
</CodeGroup>
